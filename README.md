Exploring the execution flow of JavaScript through small programs focused on functions, scopes, memory, and core language behavior.
# JavaScript Execution Flow Programs

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript programs created to explore and understand the internal execution flow of JavaScript.  
The focus is on mastering how JavaScript handles functions, scopes, memory allocation, hoisting, closures, and basic operations at a deeper level.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Function Declarations and Expressions
- Execution Context and Call Stack
- Variable Scope (Global, Function, Block)
- Hoisting Behavior
- Closures and Lexical Environment
- Primitive vs Reference Types
- Memory Management Concepts
- Asynchronous Execution Basics (setTimeout, Promises)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Build a strong foundational understanding of how JavaScript works under the hood.
- Visualize and trace execution contexts, scopes, and memory behavior.
- Prepare for technical interviews by deeply understanding language mechanics.
- Improve ability to debug and write optimized, clean JavaScript code.

## ðŸ›  Repository Organization
- Each program focuses on a single concept or behavior.
- Clear comments are included to explain step-by-step execution.
- Folder structure categorizes programs by JavaScript feature.

Example Structure:

//execution context 
//hoisting variable and function
//functions working and variable scope
//shortest java program
//this === window
//undefined(allocated memory at GEC ) and defined (not allocated any memory yet)
